#Technical Document: BusMall



Overview:
    BusMall, a startup business similar to SkyMall catalog on passenger planes, wants to expand on this concept and offer bus riders a similar experience during their daily commutes. Catalogs will be placed on Puget Sound regional transit system buses which have comparable travel times to cross-country flights. Since catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, and the products cost money to make and warehouse, and BusMall is a lean startup that needs to carefully watch its expenditures, BusMall wants to feature only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell. This means that BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest... before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.

Functionality:
  What does it do:
    A webpage that displays three images for consideration by the marketing team for inclusion on the BusMall website. The three images will be displayed side by side and will be clickable. The webpage will contain user stories. Images will not repeat immediately after the user views them the once. All the images displayed during a single instance will be unique. All images should have the same dimension. The site will contain basic analytics functionality in order to be most beneficial to the marketing team and insure the end product meets these requirements.

  Future considerations:
    The webpage should be developed using best practices and dry code to ensure future expandability.

  Failure conditions:
    None at this time.

  One time operations:
    No user configuration or one time user input is required beyond clicking to vote on each iterated webpage.

  Input limitations:
    No results for user voting will be displayed until after 25 clicks have been made then the voting will shut down and no further voting will be allowed.
